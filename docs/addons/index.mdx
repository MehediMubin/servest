# Addons

**Servest Addons** allow you to quickly enhance your project with utilities, integrations, or pre-configured setups. Addons are framework- and runtime-agnostic, meaning they can work across Node.js frameworks like Express, Fastify, NestJS, and future runtimes like Bun, Python, PHP, or Go.

---

## How Addons Work

### Scaffold a New Project :

```bash
npx create-servest@latest my-backend-app -- --template <templateName>
cd my-backend-app
```

> You can also add servest addons in your existent backend projects

### Initialize Servest :

```bash
npx servest@latest init
```

### **Add One or Multiple Addons**

```bash
npx servest@latest add <feature>

<--Example-->
npx servest@latest add f-auth
npx servest@latest add mongoose

<-- Multiple addons can be added in one command:-->
npx servest@latest add eslint prettier prisma
```

## What Happens When You Add an Addon

- üèóÔ∏è Updates your **project structure** (MVC or modular) automatically.
- üì¶ Installs all required **dependencies** and scripts.
- ‚úÖ Keeps your setup **consistent** across projects.
- üîó Ensures addons work **together without conflict**.

## Framework-Specific Addons

Currently, **Express** is the only supported framework.  
In future releases, addons will include support for:

- Node.js frameworks ‚Üí NestJS, Fastify, Koa
- Python ‚Üí Django, FastAPI
- PHP ‚Üí Laravel
- Go (planned)

Each framework will have its own section under `/addons/`.

## Best Practices

- Always run `npx servest@latest init` before adding addons.
- Add multiple features in one command to save time.
- Use addons to standardize your development workflow.
