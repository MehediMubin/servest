# Servest Guide

## Overview

`Servest` is a modern backend project scaffolding and addon generator, inspired by **create-vite** and **shadcn/ui**, but built entirely for backend frameworks. It helps you quickly create structured backend starter projects and extend them with ready-to-use features.

`Servest` is framework- and runtime-agnostic â€” currently supporting `Express`, with **Django**, **Fastify**, **NestJS**, **Laravel**, and more coming soon.

It consists of two main parts:

- `create-servest` â€” The CLI tool used to scaffold new backend projects instantly.
- `servest (addons)` â€” A flexible extension system for generating modules, middleware, and integrations (authentication, databases, utilities) inside existing projects.

You can think of Servest as:

> create-vite + shadcn, but for backend frameworks.

Together, they provide a smooth developer experience, eliminating configuration hassles and repetitive setup, and can significantly speed up backend project development using ready-to-use templates and addons â€” or both combined.

---

## Runtime Compatibility

Servest currently runs on `Node.js 18+` (tested on 20.x and 22.x).  
Some addons may require a higher Node version depending on their dependencies.

> ðŸ’¡ Ensure your Node version supports ES modules and `import.meta` syntax.

**Future Runtime Support**

Servest will support additional runtimes beyond Node.js.  
For these, prebuilt runtime packages (APKs) will be provided, allowing projects to run seamlessly across environments.

This approach ensures Servest remains **framework- and runtime-agnostic**, letting you combine templates and addons in any supported runtime.

## Try Servest Online

You can try `Servest` templates online on `StackBlitz`
â€” no local setup required.
Each template runs a backend environment pre-configured with Servestâ€™s project structure and dependencies.

You can open a template directly using the following links:

| Template            | Runtime | Link                                                                                                       |

## How Servest Works

`Servest` lets you scaffold backend projects and extend them instantly with built-in addons.

### Scaffolding your first **Servest** project

- CLI tool to scaffold backend project templates.

```bash
{
  "npm": "npm create servest@latest",
  "yarn": "yarn create servest",
  "pnpm": "pnpm create servest",
  "bun": "bun create servest",
  "deno": "deno init --npm servest"
}
```

Then follow the prompts!

### Non-interactive scaffolding.

You can directly specify the project name and template via CLI options:

_npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:_

```bash
npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use Dot (**.**) as the project name to scaffold in the current directory:

### Scaffolding with addons.

You can combine create-servest and servest-addons to speed up the process

```bash
npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth f-articles mongoose eslint-prettier
```

See [create-servest](https://github.com/dev-rashedin/servest/tree/main/packages/create-servest/templates) for more details on each supported template: `express-basic-js`, `express-basic-ts`, `express-mvc-cjs`, `express-mvc-esm`, `express-mvc-ts`, `express-modular-cjs`, `express-modular-esm`, `express-modular-ts`.

To know more about create-servest please visit [create-servest](https://www.servest.dev/addons) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-servest)

To know more about servest-addons please visit [servest-addons](https://www.servest.dev/addons) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servest)

You can also use a tool like [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is on GitHub and uses `main` as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:

```bash
npx degit user/project#main my-project
cd my-project

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Manual Installation

In your project, you can install the `vite` CLI using:

```bash
{
  "npm": "npm install -D servest",
  "yarn": "yarn add -D servest",
  "pnpm": "pnpm add -D servest",
  "bun": "bun add -d servest",
  "deno": "deno install --allow-net --name=servest npm:servest"
}
```

## Future Plan

Servest aims to become the **create-vite for backend** â€” providing a unified scaffolding experience across all major backend frameworks and runtimes.

**Upcoming goals:**

- Add support for **NestJS**, **Fastify**, and **Laravel**.
- Add **StackBlitz** and **GitHub Codespaces** integration.
- Build **official addons library** for backend utilities.
