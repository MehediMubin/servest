# Servest Guide

## Overview

`Servest` is a modern backend project scaffolding and addon generator, inspired by **create-vite** and **shadcn/ui**, but built entirely for backend frameworks. It helps you quickly create structured backend starter projects and extend them with ready-to-use features.

`Servest` is framework- and runtime-agnostic â€” currently supporting `Express`, with **Fastify**, **NestJS**, **Django**, **Laravel**, and more coming soon.

It consists of two main parts:

- `create-servest` â€” The CLI tool used to scaffold new backend projects instantly.
- `servest (addons)` â€” A flexible extension system for generating modules, middleware, and integrations (authentication, databases, utilities) inside existing projects.

You can think of Servest as:

> create-vite + shadcn, but for backend frameworks.

Together, they provide a smooth developer experience, eliminating configuration hassles and repetitive setup, and can significantly speed up backend project development using ready-to-use templates and addons â€” or both combined.

---

## Runtime Compatibility

Servest currently runs on `Node.js 18+` (tested on 20.x and 22.x).  
Some addons may require a higher Node version depending on their dependencies.

> ðŸ’¡ Ensure your Node version supports ES modules and `import.meta` syntax.

**Future Runtime Support**

Servest will support additional runtimes beyond Node.js.  
For these, prebuilt runtime packages (APKs) will be provided, allowing projects to run seamlessly across environments.

This approach ensures Servest remains **framework- and runtime-agnostic**, letting you combine templates and addons in any supported runtime.

## Try Servest Online

You can try `Servest` templates online on `StackBlitz`
â€” no local setup required.
Each template runs a backend environment pre-configured with Servestâ€™s project structure and dependencies.

You can open a template directly using the following links:

## How Servest Works

`Servest` lets you scaffold backend projects and extend them instantly with built-in addons.

### Scaffolding your first **Servest** project

Use the CLI tool to scaffold backend project templates and then follow the prompts:

```bash
{
  "npm": "npm create servest@latest",
  "yarn": "yarn create servest",
  "pnpm": "pnpm create servest",
  "bun": "bun create servest",
  "deno": "deno init --npm servest"
}
```

visit the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-servest) or check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dev-rashedin/servest/blob/main/packages/create-servest/README.md)

### Non-interactive scaffolding

You can directly specify the project name and template via CLI options:

_npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:_

```bash
npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts
```

See [create-servest templates](https://github.com/dev-rashedin/servest/tree/main/packages/create-servest/templates) for more details on each supported template: `express-basic-js`, `express-basic-ts`, `express-mvc-cjs`, `express-mvc-esm`, `express-mvc-ts`, `express-modular-cjs`, `express-modular-esm`, `express-modular-ts`.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use Dot (`.`) as the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

### Scaffolding with addons

You can automatically include additional utilities during scaffolding using the `-a` or `--addons` flag:

```bash
npm create servest@latest -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth mongoose eslint-prettier lint-staged
```

This will scaffold the `express-mvc-ts` project and install the required npm packages to enhance your development workflow.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: If any addon fails, the remaining ones will still be applied. You can re-run the failed addons manually later.

To learn more about servest addons, visit the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servest) or check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dev-rashedin/servest/blob/main/packages/servest-addons/README.md)

## Community Templates

`Servest` lets you quickly start backend projects using **ready-made templates**.  
Youâ€™re not limited to the official ones â€” you can also use **community-maintained templates** from GitHub or elsewhere.

To use a community template from GitHub:

```bash
# Copy the template files to a new folder
npx degit user/project my-project
cd my-project

# Install the project dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

> ðŸ’¡ Some repositories use `main` instead of `master` as their default branch. In that case, add `#main` to the repo name:

```bash
npx degit user/project#main my-project
```

## Future Plan

Servest aims to become the **create-vite for backend development** â€” a unified scaffolding and addon ecosystem across all major backend frameworks and runtimes.

**Upcoming goals:**

- Add support for **NestJS**, **Fastify**, **Django**, and **Laravel**.
- Build an official addon library for common backend utilities
