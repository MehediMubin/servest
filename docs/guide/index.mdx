# Servest Overview

Servest is a backend project scaffolding and addon generator built to make backend development fast, consistent, and framework-agnostic.

It helps you create production-ready backend templates â€” powered by Express.js (and soon other runtimes like Go, Python, and PHP).

Servest consists of two main parts:

- **create-servest** â€” The CLI tool used to scaffold new backend projects instantly.
- **servest (addons)** â€” A powerful extension system that lets you generate new modules, middleware, and integrations (like authentication, databases, and utilities) inside your existing project.

Together, they provide a Vite-like developer experience â€” but for backend frameworks.

Whether youâ€™re building a simple API or a complex modular architecture, Servest ensures your project starts with clean, modern conventions and can grow with you.

## Installing Servest

Use the following commands depending on your package manager:

```bash
{
"npm": "npm create servest@latest",
"yarn": "yarn create servest",
"pnpm": "pnpm create servest",
"bun": "bun create servest",
"deno": "deno init --npm servest"
}
```

Then follow the prompts to select your preferred template.

### Example: Create an Express MVC (TypeScript) Project

npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth f-articles mongoose eslint-prettier

This command:

- Creates a new Express MVC + TypeScript project
- Installs pre-configured dependencies
- Generates authentication, article routes, Mongoose, and ESLint + Prettier setup instantly

---

## Preinstalled Packages

Each Servest template comes with a curated set of dependencies to give you a ready-to-go developer environment.

For **Express templates**, these packages are preinstalled:

| Package               | Purpose                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| express               | Core web framework               |
| cors                  | Cross-origin resource sharing    |
| dotenv                | Environment variable management  |
| express-error-toolkit | Clean error handling & responses |
| nodemon (dev)         | Auto-reload during development   |

Additional addons (like Mongoose, Prisma, Auth, ESLint, etc.) can be installed via the [Servest Addons CLI](/addons).
