## Overview

Servest is a backend project scaffolding and addon generator built to make backend development fast, consistent, and framework-agnostic.  
 It helps you create production-ready backend templates — powered by Express.js (and soon other runtimes like Go, Python, and PHP).

Servest consists of two main parts:

- **create-servest** — The CLI tool used to scaffold new backend projects instantly.
- **servest (addons)** — A powerful extension system that lets you generate new modules, middleware, and integrations (like authentication, databases, and utilities) inside your existing project.

Together, they provide a _Vite-like_ developer experience — but for backend frameworks.

You can think of Servest as:

> 🧱 “Vite + shadcn, but for backend frameworks.”

Whether you’re building a simple API or a complex modular architecture, Servest ensures your project starts with clean, modern conventions and can grow with you.

## Why Servest?

Backend projects often start from scratch — repetitive setups, boilerplate files, repeated configurations. Servest eliminates all of that.

With Servest you get:

- **Instant project setup** — scaffold Express templates with one command.
- **Addon-based system** — add features like authentication, Mongoose, Prisma, or ESLint anytime.
- **Consistent folder structure** — all templates follow modern conventions (MVC, REST, modular, etc.).
- **Runtime & framework agnostic design** — Node.js first, but extensible for future runtimes.
- **Better DX (Developer Experience)** — clean, predictable, and expandable CLI design.

You can learn more about specific addons in the [Addons Guide](/addons).

## Scaffolding Your First Servest Project

```bash
{
  "npm": "npm create servest@latest",
  "pnpm": "pnpm create servest",
  "yarn": "yarn create servest"
}
```

Then follow the prompts to select your preferred template.

### Example: Create an Express MVC (TypeScript) Project

      npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth f-articles mongoose eslint-prettier

This command:

- Creates a new Express MVC + TypeScript project
- Installs pre-configured dependencies
- Generates authentication, article routes, Mongoose, and ESLint + Prettier setup instantly

## Preinstalled Packages

Each Servest template comes with a curated set of dependencies to give you a ready-to-go developer environment.

For **Express templates**, these packages are preinstalled:

| Package               | Purpose                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| express               | Core web framework               |
| cors                  | Cross-origin resource sharing    |
| dotenv                | Environment variable management  |
| express-error-toolkit | Clean error handling & responses |
| nodemon (dev)         | Auto-reload during development   |

Additional addons (like Mongoose, Prisma, Auth, ESLint, etc.) can be installed via the [Servest Addons CLI](/addons).

## Template Types

Currently available templates (Node.js + Express):

| Template Name     | Description                    |

| express-api       | REST API structure             |
| express-api-ts    | REST API + TypeScript          |
| express-mvc       | MVC folder pattern             |
| express-mvc-ts    | MVC + TypeScript               |

## Manual Installation

      # npm
      npm install -D servest

      # yarn
      yarn add -D servest

      # pnpm
      pnpm add -D servest

      # bun
      bun add -D servest

Then you can run the Servest CLI inside your project:

      npx servest add f-auth

That will generate the full authentication feature with routes, controller, and service pre-configured.

---

## Command Line Interface

Once installed, Servest provides two primary CLIs:

| Command        | Description                                   |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| create-servest | Scaffold new backend projects                 |
| servest        | Add or remove addons, utilities, and features |

### Example Commands

      # Create new project
      npm create servest@latest my-api -- --template express-api-ts

      # Add Mongoose addon
      npx servest add mongoose

      # Add Auth + ESLint + Prettier
      npx servest add f-auth eslint-prettier

Run `npx servest --help` for a full list of available commands.

## Node.js Compatibility

Servest requires **Node.js 18+** (tested on 20.x and 22.x).  
 Some addons may require a higher version depending on dependencies.

> 💡 Make sure your Node version supports ES modules and import.meta syntax.
