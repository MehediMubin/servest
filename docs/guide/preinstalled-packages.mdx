## Preinstalled Packages

Each Servest template comes with a curated set of dependencies to give you a ready-to-go developer environment.

For **Express templates**, these packages are preinstalled:

| Package               | Purpose                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| express               | Core web framework               |
| cors                  | Cross-origin resource sharing    |
| dotenv                | Environment variable management  |
| express-error-toolkit | Clean error handling & responses |
| nodemon (dev)         | Auto-reload during development   |

Additional addons (like Mongoose, Prisma, Auth, ESLint, etc.) can be installed via the [Servest Addons CLI](/addons).
