## Why Use Servest

## Why Servest

Setting up backend projects manually often means repeating the same steps — configuring ESLint, setting up ORM, folder structures, etc. Servest eliminates this by providing pre-configured templates and add-ons that can be extended anytime.

- 🚀 **Fast project setup** — ready in seconds.
- 🧩 **Addons system** — add features anytime.
- 🧱 **Framework agnostic** — works with Node, Python, PHP, and more.
- ⚙️ **Customizable** — modify, extend, or combine templates.

## Why Servest?

Backend projects often start from scratch — repetitive setups, boilerplate files, repeated configurations. Servest eliminates all of that.

With Servest you get:

- **Instant project setup** — scaffold Express templates with one command.
- **Addon-based system** — add features like authentication, Mongoose, Prisma, or ESLint anytime.
- **Consistent folder structure** — all templates follow modern conventions (MVC, REST, modular, etc.).
- **Runtime & framework agnostic design** — Node.js first, but extensible for future runtimes.
- **Better DX (Developer Experience)** — clean, predictable, and expandable CLI design.
