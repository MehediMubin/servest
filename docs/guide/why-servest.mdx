# Why Servest

## The Problem

Starting a backend project usually involves repeating the same setup steps:

- Creating folder structures (MVC, modular, REST, etc.)
- Configuring ESLint, Prettier, or lint-staged
- Setting up ORMs like Mongoose or Prisma
- Wiring authentication, routes, and middleware

These repetitive tasks slow down development and introduce inconsistencies.

## How Servest Solves This

`Servest` removes all the boilerplate by providing:

- **Pre-configured templates** — scaffold backend projects instantly.
- **Addon system** — add features like database integrations, or linting anytime.
- **Consistent folder structure** — all templates follow modern conventions (MVC, REST, modular, etc.).
- **Framework- and runtime-agnostic design** — Node.js first, but future runtimes like Python, PHP, or Go are planned.
- **Better developer experience** — clean, predictable CLI with repeatable workflows.

### Key Benefits

- **Fast project setup** — ready in seconds.
- **Addons on-demand** — extend projects whenever needed.
- **Reusable templates** — modify or combine templates across projects.
- **Enhanced DX** — saves 5–10x the setup time compared to manual configuration.

## Why Servest Over Manual Setup?

Even if you know how to set up a backend from scratch, Servest:

- Eliminates repetitive work
- Ensures consistent structure and dependencies
- Lets you focus on writing business logic instead of wiring boilerplate
- Enables faster onboarding for team members

## Conclusion

`Servest` acts as a **modern backend scaffolding tool**, similar to what `create-vite` and `shadcn/ui` did for frontend development, giving developers a fast, consistent, and extendable foundation to build backend projects efficiently.
