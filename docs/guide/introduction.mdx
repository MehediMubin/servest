# Introduction

Servest is a next‑generation backend project generator built to simplify how developers start backend applications.  
It offers two powerful CLI tools — **create‑servest** and **servest** — that together provide an instant backend setup experience.

### What It Does

- **create‑servest**: Quickly scaffold a complete backend project using ready‑made templates (currently Express).
- **servest**: Instantly add backend features and utilities (like ESLint, Prettier, or Mongoose) to any existing project.

### Why It Matters

Servest bridges the speed of Vite’s project scaffolding with the modularity of shadcn’s addon approach — but for backend frameworks.  
You can generate and configure a production‑ready backend with a single command.

### Example

```bash
npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth f-articles mongoose eslint-prettier
```

This command:

- Creates a new Express MVC TypeScript project
- Installs pre‑configured addons (auth, articles, mongoose, eslint+prettier)
- Sets up everything in one step

### Key Highlights

- 🚀 **Fast:** One‑command project creation
- ⚙️ **Customizable:** Add or remove features anytime
- 🧩 **Modular:** Use addons for utilities, auth, database, and more
- 🌐 **Agnostic:** Built to support multiple runtimes and frameworks in the future
