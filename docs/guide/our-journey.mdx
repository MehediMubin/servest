# Our Journey

## How Servest Started

Working on backend projects often meant repeating the same boring tasks over and over:

- Setting up folders and files
- Configuring ESLint and Prettier
- Installing TypeScript and other dependencies
- Copying code from old projects

It was slow, tedious, and error-prone. We wanted a faster, easier way.

Inspired by tools like `create-vite` for instant project setup, and `shadcn/ui` for ready-to-use components, we asked:

> Why not build something similar for backend development?

And so, **Servest** was born — a simple tool to create backend servers in the fastest and easiest way possible. That’s why we named it `Servest`: **Serve + Easiest**.

## Our Goal

Servest aims to save developers time and frustration by:

- Providing ready-to-use templates for backend projects
- Offering an easy addon system to extend projects with features like eslint-prettier setup, database integration, and more
- Making project setup consistent, reliable, and fast

## The Vision

We want `Servest` to become the **go-to tool** for backend and full-stack developers. In the future, it will:

- Support multiple popular runtimes and frameworks
- Offer official and community addons for almost every common backend task
- Make starting a backend project as easy as running one command

With `Servest`, backend development should feel smooth, simple, and enjoyable — just like modern frontend tooling.
