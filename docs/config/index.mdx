# Config

Every Servest project depends on a `servest.config.json` file.  
This file defines the project’s structure, environment, and enabled features.  
It is created automatically when you initialize a project:

```bash
npx servest@latest init
```

All addons and later commands rely on this file. If it is missing or incomplete, Servest cannot continue.

## Example

```json
{
  "servestVersion": "1.0.0",
  "framework": "express",
  "language": "ts",
  "architecture": "mvc",
  "srcDir": true,
  "environment": {
    "runtime": "node",
    "nodeVersion": "v22.18.0"
  },
  "features": {},
  "createdAt": "2025-09-01T07:23:37.385Z"
}
```

## Sections

### Project Options

Defines the main project setup:

- **framework** – backend framework (e.g. `express`, `django`, `fastapi`, `laravel`)
- **language** – programming language used (`js`, `ts`, `py`, `php`)
- **architecture** – project structure (`basic`, `mvc`, `modular`, `apps-based`, `laravel-mvc`)
- **srcDir** – whether the project uses a `/src` directory

### Environment Options

Specifies runtime environment:

- **runtime** – runtime environment (`node`, `bun`, `python`, `php`)
- **nodeVersion** – Node.js version (only if runtime is `node`)
- **bunVersion** – Bun version (only if runtime is `bun`)

### Features

Tracks enabled addons:

- Populated when you run `npx servest@latest add <feature>`
- Keeps addon state consistent across commands

### Meta

Additional metadata:

- **servestVersion** – version of Servest used to generate this file
- **createdAt** – timestamp when the config was created

### Why This Config Matters

- Every command in Servest depends on `servest.config.json`
- Ensures consistent project setup across environments
- Allows addons and features to integrate smoothly
- Acts as the **single source of truth** for your project settings
